# Electron-Store-Persistence

Electron is a framework that enables you to create desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Electron is built and mantained by Github. As Electron is used to built native applications, the authentication process and user data persistence is different from the one we implement in building web applications.

This repo includes code for basic Electron login system and data persistence using electron-store package. The electron-settings package provides api that has functionality similar to the web browser localStorage, so makes it easier for web developoers to use it and apply the user data persistence and authentication.
